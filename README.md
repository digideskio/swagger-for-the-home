### Swagger for the home

Project to make an API for my house.  Based on the following:

* [Phidgets SBC](http://www.phidgets.com/) running Debian

* [Swagger for Node Express](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-node-express).  Node is so lightweight that it's a great
choice for running on the sbc.

### Getting started

Installing node on the phidget is no simple task.  I followed [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/1574158).  They pretty much work, but you need to install npm from the build folder, not from the npmjs.org script.
